There are 25 primes between 1 and 100. As a result, exactly 3 primes are in
their right place. There are also 75 non-prime numbers.

Let's say that $i = the number of primes out of the 22 that are found in
non-prime positions. As a result, 22-$i primes are found in out of place prime
positions. Moreover, 25-$i primes are in primes' positions. Furthermore, $i
composite numbers are in primes positions. And 75-$i composite numbers are in
composites' positions.

Let's say that $j = the number of composites that are found in the right place.
We can see that $j <= 75 - $i .

If $i = 0 :
-----------

All primes are in prime-numbered positions, just not in the correct place.
3 of them are in their correct places, and there are C(25,3) possibilities for
them. The first of the out of place primes' (let's say the minimal place) places
can be one of 21 possibilities. Let's call it "$a". Now let's put a
